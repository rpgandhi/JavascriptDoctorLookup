# Doctor Lookup

This is a project created for the Epicodus code challenge for week 3 of Javascript. It uses the BetterDoctor API to allow users to search for doctors by name and get a list of results including the doctor's name, address, phone number, website (if any), and whether they are accepting new patients. It also allows the user to search by symptom or condition and get a list of doctors who treat that symptom or condition.
